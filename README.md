## YelloTrello - [Live Demo]( https://truptigaonkar.github.io/stunning-system/)
## Group Project - Communication & Agile project methods
Build your own Trello (https://trello.com)

### Instructions
* More than one list (at least three). Advantage is if you can dynamically create and delete lists.
* Each list can have a dynamic number of "items" that we can create, delete and edit.
* Each item should contain a title, description and date of creation.
* It is possible to move an item between lists (preferably with drag & drop).
* No backend connection should be made, but all information should be stored in JS memory.

### OptionalExtra stuff:
* One should be able to create several "boards"
* Items should have comments

### Recommendations
* Structure the code with MVC
* Write tests for the models (please try TDD)
* Use mocha.js for the tests
* Divide the project into parts between each other. Keep track of who does what and how far each person has come using Trello (the real one).
* Divide the project into multiple files, use rollup.js or the like
* Write the project with native-js, ie try to solve it without any library or framework. You will of course be allowed to use libraries, but you will learn more if you do everything yourself.
